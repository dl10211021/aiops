# OpsCore Release Checklist

## Before Release

- Run `python scripts/preflight.py`.

## Smoke Test

- Open dashboard and verify asset totals.
- Open asset center and verify asset protocol/tool visibility.
- Run one Linux read-only inspection.
- Run protocol verification from asset center for at least one asset in each available class: Linux/SSH, Windows/WinRM, SQL DB, HTTP/API or Prometheus, SNMP/network.
- Confirm every non-SSH verification shows `协议原生探测` before `只读巡检`.
- Run one Windows or database read-only inspection if available and confirm the result uses managed asset credentials.
- Trigger or inspect one high-risk approval and confirm it appears in approval center.
- Verify model provider config loads without exposing API keys.

## Rollback

## Post Release
